# ConstraintProblemSatisfaction
Constraint Problem Satisfaction Solver implemented for an academic laboratory purpose.
Code allows to solve CSP problem by using ForwardChecking and Backtracking algorithms to find solutions.
It was projected to solve universal CSP problem by using concept of variables and constraints bound to them.
